 ## What is Prometheus?
 - Prometheus is an open source monitoring tool
 - Provides out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities for the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. It can monitor servers and databases as well.
 - Collects and stores metrics as time-series data, recording information with a timestamp 
 - It is based on pull and collects metrics from targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.
 - It makes use of PromQL which is a very powerful query language to pull the time series data.
 - It can be used with Grafana for visualization of time-series data produced by prometheus.
 
   ### Features:
